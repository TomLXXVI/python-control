    """Determines the required forward gain for the unity-feedback system with
    forward-path transfer function G(s), such that the desired damping ratio is
    attained.
    
    How it works:
    The root locus of the unity-feedback system is determined. Points in the
    positive left-half of the complex s-plane with the same damping ratio lie 
    on a straight ray from the origin (on the positive imagary axis the damping 
    ratio is 0 and on the negative real axis the damping ratio is 1).
    Along the given damping ratio line, points are searched for where the root 
    locus crosses the damping ratio line. For this, the damping ratio line
    is first subdivided into a number of intervals (keyword argument `r_num`, 
    default value 100) between a minimum radius (keyword `r_min`, default value
    0.0) and a maximum radius (keyword `r_max`, default value 20.0). If there
    are intervals where the angle of the root locus passes through 180Â°, Scipy's
    root finding algorithm `root_scalar` is used in these intervals to find
    the crossing-point more precisely. Each crossing-point corresponds with a
    certain gain value (i.e. the multiplication factor for which the magnitude
    of the open-loop transfer function vector becomes 1). This open-loop or
    forward-path gain value is then required value for the crossing-point 
    (a complex number) to be a stable, closed-loop pole of the unity-feedback 
    system.
    If multiple crossing-points are found, the crossing-point closest to the
    imaginary axis is considered to be the "dominant pole" (its conjugate in the 
    negative left-half of the complex plane will also be closed-loop pole, and
    this is called the "dominant pole pair"). The dominant pole pair has the 
    longest effect on the transient response (long settling time).
    If no crossing-points are found, a `ValueError` exception is raised. If this
    happens, one can retry the function with a larger value for `r_max` or 
    `r_num` or a smaller value for `r_min` (however `r_min` cannot be smaller 
    than zero). If no keyword arguments `r_min`, `r_num`, and `r_max` are
    specified, the function will try 3 times to find crossing-points by 
    increasing the number of search intervals along the damping ratio line 
    between the default value of `r_min` (0) and `r_max` (20). The number of
    points is increased by a factor of 10 each time.

    """Designs the transfer function for a lead compensator. Determines the 
    location of the compensator pole in the s-plane such that the required 
    transient response requirements are met, while the location of the 
    compensator zero is already given. Note that the gain of the lead 
    compensator is not determined by this function. To determine the gain use 
    the function `design_unity_feedback` next.
    
    How it works:
    The transient response requirements determine the location of a dominant
    complex pole pair in the s-plane. At these two points, the angle of the 
    resulting open-loop transfer function must be 180Â°, so that the root locus 
    of the resulting open-loop transfer function would pass through these 
    dominant poles. 
    This is accomplished by placing an extra zero and pole in the s-plane. The 
    zero of the compensator on the negative real axis of the s-plane is already 
    selected. The location of the compensator pole on the real axis is then 
    determined such that the total angle of the resulting open-loop transfer
    function is 180Â°.
    
    In the case of a true lead compensator, the compensator pole lies to the 
    left of the compensator zero on the real axis of the s-plane (is more 
    negative than the compensator zero). However, when using this method, it may
    happen that the compensator pole will be to the right of the compensator 
    zero. If that's the case, the compensator is actually a lag compensator.   
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    settling_time:
        Required settling time of the lead-compensated system. If `None`,
        parameter `peak_time` must be set.
    peak_time:
        Required peak time of the lead-compensated system. If `None`, parameter
        `settling_time` must be set.
    damping_ratio:

    G_plant:
        Transfer function of the plant or process.
    zero_c:
        Selected compensator zero. In general the zero is placed on the
        negative real axis at a distance from the origin in the neighborhood of
        the natural frequency of the uncompensated system's dominant pole (1/4
        to 1 times the value of the natural frequency).
    gain_symbol:
        Sympy symbol to be used to represent the gain of the compensator.
        The default symbol is the predefined symbol `K` from the
        `python_control` package.

    """Designs a minor-loop feedback compensation system consisting of a minor
    and a major loop. The minor loop contains the transfer function of the plant
    (process) in its forward path (without forward-path gain). The transfer
    function $H(s)$ of the compensator in the feedback path of the minor loop
    must be given when calling this function. The major loop has no transfer
    function in its feedback path (i.e. $H = 1$, unity-feedback) and a Sympy
    symbol to be used to represent its forward-path gain can be passed when
    calling this function.

    First, the required gain of the feedback compensator in the minor loop is
    determined and the minor loop is then reduced into a single transfer
    function, which is the forward-path transfer function of the major loop.
    Next, the required forward-path gain of the major loop can determined.
