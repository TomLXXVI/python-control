"""
Implements mesh analysis of an electrical network based on
"Control Systems Engineering, EMEA Edition, 8th Edition", ยง 2.4 "Electrical
Network Transfer Functions" - "Complex Circuits via Mesh Analysis".

The same mesh analysis can also be used with mechanical systems in which case a
mesh corresponds with a body in the mechanical system (see "Control Systems
Engineering", ยง 2.9). A force counteracting the movement of a body is
represented by the product of a mechanical impedance and the velocity of the
body (F(s) = Z * V(s)). Impedances between two bodies are also common to two
meshes. External forces applied to a body can be represented as a voltage
source in the mesh of the body. The mesh current represents the velocity of the
body.
