    "We consider the quarter-car model of an automobile suspension system. The system can be approximated by two masses: the mass of one car wheel $m_1$ and a quarter of the car's mass (minus the mass of the four wheels) $m_2$. The suspension system consists of a spring and a dashpot between these two masses. The compressible air cushion in the tire of the wheel is also modeled as a spring that works between the mass of the wheel $m_1$ and the road surface. \n",

    "To derive the equations of motion of this two-mass system, we could draw free body diagrams of both masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ and then apply the principle of superposition to arrive at the equation of motion for each of the two masses. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this for mass $m_1$, there are three cases to consider:\n",
    "1. Mass $m_1$ is moving, while mass $m_2$ is still and the road profile is flat, i.e. $r(t) = 0$. The forces excerted by the springs and dashpot are solely caused by the displacement of mass $m_1$.\n",
    "2. Mass $m_2$ is moving, while mass $m_1$ is still and the road profile is flat. The forces excerted by the springs and dashpot are solely caused by the displacement of mass $m_2$. In this case, the spring force exerted by the air cushion in the tire will be zero, as there is no relative movement between mass $m_1$ and the road surface. \n",
    "3. The road has e.g. a bump, i.e. $r(t) > 0$, while the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are still. The forces excerted by the springs and the dashpot are solely caused by the bump in the road. Because the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are still and therefore in their equilibrium position like when the car is standing still, the only force acting in this case is the spring force caused by the air cushion in the tire of the wheel. This force can be expressed as $k_w \\cdot r(t)$ and is acting vertically upwards on mass $m_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forces that are acting on mass $m_1$ in the three cases can now be added (while taking care of the signs, i.e. paying attention to the direction in which each of the forces is acting; if we define the positive motion of $m_1$ vertically upward, a force that acts on $m_1$ in the vertically downward direction must be negative). According to Newton's second law, and if we consider the acceleration of mass $m_1$ as part of the inertia force, i.e. ${m_1} \\cdot {\\ddot x_1}$, the sum of all forces must, either be zero, or equal to the sum of external forces applied to mass $m_1$. In this problem here, the spring force associated with the compressible air cushion in the tire of the wheel in the third case above acts as an external force excerted by the road on the two-mass system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of motion of mass $m_2$ can be derived following a similar procedure as for mass $m_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a more quicker way to arrive at the equations of motion of this two-mass system is the *impedance-method*, which we will use below."

    "It should be noted that the gravity force, which is acting on mass $m_1$ and mass $m_2$, is not being considered in the analysis. The displacements of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are measured from their static equilibrium position. Under static equilibrium (the car is standing still), the weight of the masses (due to the gravity force) are counterbalanced by the forces of the springs in the system. This also remains true when the car is riding. But this also means that the static components of the spring forces are left out from the analysis."
