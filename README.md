# A(nother) Python package about Control Theory.

This package was written while studying the (very good) book **Control Systems Engineering**, Eight Edition (EMEA Edition) written by **Norman S. Nise**. The reason I began to write this package, was because I don't have Matlab.
It mainly uses [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and [Python Control Systems Library](https://github.com/python-control/python-control). Some other third-party packages were used as well. All packages that were used to put this package together, are mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

In the `docs` folder, examples (Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts) are included showing how to use this package can be used. In fact, all examples were taken from the above mentioned book. The titles of the Jupyter notebooks refer to the chapters in this book. 
Going through these examples and with the help of the docstrings in the source code, one should be able to decipher the package fairly quickly and without much effort.
