# A(nother) Python package about Control Theory.

This package is written based on the book **Control Systems Engineering**, Eight Edition (EMEA Edition) written by **Norman S. Nise**. 
It mainly uses [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and [Python Control Systems Library](https://github.com/python-control/python-control), but some other third-party packages have also been used. All third-party packages used to put this package together, are listed in the `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` files.

In the `docs` folder, examples (Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts) are included showing the usage of the package. These examples solve (almost all of) the examples in the above mentioned book (however, the images in the examples of the book haven't been included to the repository). The file names of the Jupyter notebooks and scripts refer to the chapter numbers in the book. Going through these examples and with the help of the docstrings in the source code, one should be able to discover the possibilities of the package fairly quickly and without too much effort.
